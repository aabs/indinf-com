<p>Eric Gunnerson, has a very true post about how many of&nbsp;those who manage or participate in software development have caught the&nbsp;<em>&#39;lets post-modernise our language to pretend we&#39;re innovating, rather then give an extra effort to clarify our thinking</em>&#39;&nbsp;bug. Lately, I have been bending poor Kerry&#39;s ear about this&nbsp;to the extent that I am now categorised as a grumpy old man. Not that I care what the world thinks, but I think that language has more value if it is clear.</p>
<p>But, you tell me, which of the following alternatives makes more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#39;newborn services department&#39; or &#39;maternity ward&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;waste transfer depot&#39; or &#39;dump&#39;</li>
<li>&#39;personalized, post-branded attentionstream&#39; or &#39;blog&#39;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I may be revealing my Anglosaxon roots, but I think that this is another form of frenchifying words to make them seem more poncy.</p>
<p>It&#39;s great for recreation, but not a good way to get my attention[stream] at least.</p>
