Joe Duffy is busy at work writing a book about concurrency in .NET. He [asks](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,20a3f9c3-c33b-4403-8598-ed943b578f25.aspx) how we would spend our $100, given a choice from a set of topics available. Well, I'd have to spend mine like this:


$5 - (0) Parallel algorithms (Comp Sci., technology agnostic)  
$5 - (1) Architecting large scale concurrent programs  
$5 - (2) Windows concurrency internals  
$5 - (3) CLR concurrency internals  
$5 - (4) Windows (Win32) concurrency API best practices  
$5 - (5) CLR concurrency API best practices  
$5 - (6) Client-side concurrency  
$5 - (7) Server-side concurrency  
$5 - (8) Reusable concurrency primitives (building and using them)  
$5 - (9) Performance and scalability  
$50 - (A) Debugging


And here's why. **_Because debugging concurrent systems is Ruddy Hard!!!!!_**  I wish I had $200 J
