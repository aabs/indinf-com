<p>Here&#39;s Kerry and I after a great evening at the LinkMe christmas do.</p>
<p>I must admit that it&#39;s a pleasant change to go to one of these things and have a good time, especially since for years I have adopted the &quot;forge no ties&quot; policy to my clients.</p>
<p>Oh, and the food was good too.</p>
