<p>I think this one requires no disparaging commentary, it&#39;s funereal dissatisfactoryness stands as a balefire to all of you who want to write code that is both tenebrous and brittle.</p>
<pre>adCol.Add(new
  Advertisement(dr.GetString(0),
    dr.GetDateTime(1),dr.GetString(2),
    dr.GetString(3), dr.GetInt32(4),
    dr.GetBoolean(5), dr.GetFloat(6),
    dr.GetString(7), dr.GetString(8),
    dr.GetString(9),
    dr.GetDateTime(10),
    (int)dr.GetInt16(11),
    (int)dr.GetInt16(12),
    (int)dr.GetInt16(13),
    dr.GetString(14),
    dr.GetString(15),
    dr.GetString(16),
    dr.GetString(17), dr.GetInt32(18),
    dr.GetString(19),
    dr.GetString(20),
    dr.GetString(21).ToCharArray()[0],
    dr.GetString(22).ToCharArray()[0],
    dr.GetString(23)));</pre>
<p>This example has been formatted for extra readability - it was on a single line.<br />
I would also like to point out that I had ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCTION OF THIS PIECE OF CODE! </p>
