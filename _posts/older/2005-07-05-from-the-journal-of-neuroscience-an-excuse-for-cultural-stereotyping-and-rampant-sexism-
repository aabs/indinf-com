<p>It says here: &quot;<em>in the absence of nuclear receptor 2E1 (NR2E1), even laboratory mice can become fierce, displaying pathological violent behavior</em> &quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s now obvious that the UK government has been manufacturing an NR2E1 suppressant for years and releasing it into the water supplies of council estates and spiking Stella Artois with it.</p>
<p>Do women undergo a drop in the levels of NR2E1 every month? [<em>It&#39;s just a joke, alright!</em>]</p>
<p>Presumably excess levels of NR2E1 can have the opposite effect? Whatever the truth is, I don&#39;t want an argument. OK?</p>
