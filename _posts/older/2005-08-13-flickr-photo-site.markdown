I've been rooting through my old and slightly newer photos. You can see some of the usual and not so usual suspects in compromising or not so compromising pictures with more or less amounts of alcohol in their bloodstreams.

One thing I love about Flickr (which I've also come to love about GMail) is the use of metadata tags to describe content rather than hierarchical file structures. In here I've tagged it with the who what where and when of the pictures. Let me know what you think.
