<p>Having recently been slandered, and accused of being a geek (A geek! Me?) I thought it was about time to share with you all my artistic side. And to do that I thought I would provide a link to a beautiful painting that we saw when we were in Oslo last year (or was it the year before that?) This painting totally captured my imagination, and I haven&#39;t seen anything as good in years. It is called &quot;<em>Peasant Funeral</em>&quot; by Erik Werenskiold, a Norwegian painter, about whom there is very little in English that I could find.</p>

It doesn&#39;t do the picture justice, since it is the eloquence of the expressions that catches the heart. Here&#39;s a pic I snapped with my phone, which again is not good enough to convey what I saw, but might give you a glimps of Werenskiold&#39;s skill and insight.</p>

<p>This picture makes me think of the quiet strength and dignity that Gray alludes to in his poem &quot;<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15409">An Elegy Wrote in a Country Church Yard</a>&quot;. In the details you can see the misery in this man&#39;s face, uncomprehension in the face of the child, and helplessness in the faces of the other mourners. you can see that he&#39;s lost a loved one and can&#39;t see how to cope with it, but knows that he must.</p>
<p>I guess it also weirds me out because the main character looks like my dad!</p>
