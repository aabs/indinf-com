<p>Melbourne sounds like Sydney - but not like this. Don't give up the day job Aggy.</p>
<p><strong><em>There was a young man from Melbourne<br />
who rhymes were a little seldom,<br />
He wrote and he scribed,<br />
and he thought, and he tried,<br />
but he kept getting it wrong and put Sydney.</em></strong></p>
<p align="right">by Aggy Finn, Aged 35 1/6</p>
