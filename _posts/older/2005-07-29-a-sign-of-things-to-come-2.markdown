**Lots of baby clothes**


It gives me the shivers - I see a future littered with drying stinky babies romper suits. Our neat and minimalist, and even quite stylishly modern on a good day, existence is about to become very biological. Not that I mind - I also see myself becoming virtually American in my capacity for maudlin sentimentality about fatherhood.

Like I said - very biological.
