<p><a href="http://aabs.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/childlinguisticdevelopment.pdf" target="_blank" title="This">Child LinguisticÂ Development</a> is a document that I wrote when I was at university on the stages of language development. Since Emily and Thomas are now a week short of 18 months it is time for <a href="http://kerrymatthews.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Kerry </a>and I to start learning about learning. I'd forgotten most of this stuff, so it will make interesting reading for me too! I've put a link in to kerry's gorgeous new blog/journal, where she describes her day-to-day experiences of raising twins. Hair raising more than twin raising, if you want my opinion...</p>
