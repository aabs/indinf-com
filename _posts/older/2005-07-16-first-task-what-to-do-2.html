<p>I&#39;ve posted a whole bunch (well 45) bugs on the GotDotNet bug tracker for enhancements that nORM should not have to live too long without. Some of them ought to be fairly easy to deliver, like changing method names to have a clean and consistent format. Others are a bit more of a challenge - like adding persistence support for XML documents and reverse engineering an entity model from a schema file.</p>
<p>I think that delivering these bits of functionality will take quite a while. If each of these things took an average of a week to do (which is optimistic!) It would take me about a year to deliver all of the enhancements. But by the end of that - the system will kick some serious arse!</p>
<p>The BugList/WishList page is <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/bugtracker/home.aspx?id=106b378e-00e9-4146-b812-9eabd4931e92">here</a>. Feel free to make suggestions if you can think of anything I&#39;ve missed.</p>
