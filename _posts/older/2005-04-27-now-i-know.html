<p>... why people are so keen to be famous:</p>
<p><em>Because when you're famous you can burn your bridges</em>.</p>
<p>I happen to want to burn mine so much right now, that I could spit! What was I thinking? Tomorrow would have been my last day. It still could be, but I can't just walk out, cos that would mean I might get a bad reference, which I can't afford.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!</em></strong></p>
