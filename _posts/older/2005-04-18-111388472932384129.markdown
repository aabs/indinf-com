An aesthetic criterion for truth (believing in what appeals to your sense of harmony or beauty, or believing because of moral dogma) is a primitive, religious mentality that hampers progress. It was responsible for papal inquisitions. It was responsible for the "final solution to the Jewish question", the stupidities of anti-creationism, belief in crop-circles, and countless other idiocies and cruelties down the ages.
