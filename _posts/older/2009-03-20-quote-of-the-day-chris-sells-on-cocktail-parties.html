<p>I can relate to <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2260">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'll take a lake of fire any day over more than three strangers in a room with which I share no common task and with whom I'm expected to socialize</p></blockquote>
<p>How to express this to my wife without her thinking that I am suffering from a combination of acrophobia and Downs Syndrome...?</p>
<p>BTW: I was surfing Chris' blog because I've finally made the time to explore MGrammar and the "OSLO" SDK.</p>
<p>Expect to see a resurgance of blogging on this site, as I introduce you to my new open source project.</p>
<p>Expect to hear a bit about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709420.aspx">MGrammar</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/">PEX</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell">Powershell</a>, and declarative architecture specifications...</p>
<p>... I'm excited. New toys to play with and some amazing new productivity enhancements to play with...</p>
