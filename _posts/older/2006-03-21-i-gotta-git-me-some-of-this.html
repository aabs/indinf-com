The problem with intellectual pursuits is that once you have gotten your head around a problem, no matter how difficult it seems at the outset, you are left thinking that the problem was actually quite simple. Which brings to mind Steven Wolfram's assertion that there is really only one level of complexity - our perception of higher levels of complexity is really only an awareness of our lack of insight into the problem. </font><br />
