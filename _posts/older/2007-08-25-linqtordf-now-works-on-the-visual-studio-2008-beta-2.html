<p>I should have brought the code up to date weeks back - but other things got in the way. Still - all the unit tests are in the green.&nbsp; And the code has been minimally converted over to the new .NET 3.5 framework. I say 'minimally' because with the introduction of beta 2 there is now an interface for IQueryProvider that seems to be a dispenser for objects that support IQueryable. I suspect that with IQueryProvider, there is now a canonical architecture that is recommended by the LINQ team. Probably that will mean moving more responsibility into the RDF&lt;T&gt; class away from the QuerySupertype.&nbsp; Time (and more documentation from MS) will tell.  </p>
<p>There are several new expression types that are not yet supported (such as the coalescing operator on nullable types) - it remains to be seen whether they are supportable in SPARQL at all. Further research required. The solution doesn't currently support WIX - I'm not sure whether WIX 3 will work with 2008 yet. Again, more research required.&nbsp; What that means is that there will not be any MSI releases produced till WIX supports the latest drop of VS.NET.  </p>
<p>Enjoy - and don't forget to give us plenty of feedback on your experiences </p>
