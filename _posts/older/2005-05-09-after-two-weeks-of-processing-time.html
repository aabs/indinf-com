<p>My data recovery program has started to recover files. Can you believe it? It took two whole weeks for R-Studio to index the contents of my MP3 drive. This 200GB drive got nadgered by a nice combination of travelling to work on my back every day and being used in combination with Windows XP Pro SP2 and hibernation. Just as well I didn't keep anything on there that was of immediate importance...</p>
<p>...have you backed up today?</p>
