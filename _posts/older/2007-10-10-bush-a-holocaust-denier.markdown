Is it a coincidence that in the mid-evening news there was a report that the US was doing everything in its power to broker detente between Turkey and Iraq, and an hour later I heard reports of Bush pushing the House of Representatives not to pass a bill acknowledging the [Armenian Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_massacre)?

Given the recent history of US administrations to ['reclassify' atrocities as 'not genocide' ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_the_international_community_in_the_Rwandan_Genocide#The_United_States)Â to not be morally obligated, I wouldn't be surprised.
