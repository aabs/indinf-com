Well, I'm back in work - a fact that would normally be an occasion for mourning. But, at least on this occasion, I am settling in OK. I am doing a short contract for a local classified ads company called the trading post (if you've ever seen the movie The Castle, you'll recognise the name). I will be working on redeveloping their admin back-end, and shall get more stored procedure practice than at any other time in my programming career. I guess that's a good thing - filling the skills gaps and all that. Anyway, I have an unmediated connection to the internet that allows peak download rates of around 1MB/s which is faster than I got at Telstra (bizarrely).

So expect me to be eulogising about the wonders of some huge piece of freeware or another, or to be talking about something large that I found on a P2P network.
