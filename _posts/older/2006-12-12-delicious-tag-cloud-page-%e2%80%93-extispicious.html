<p>While I was out trawling the web, I came upon <a href="http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi?name=aabs">extisp.ico.us</a> – an extremely cool little CGI app to render a tag cloud of a user's public links in del.icio.us.</p>
<p>Check it out on a friend's collection – it gives you an insight into their mind. As Aymeric, who sits beside me, said when he saw his links: '<em>zis is like looking at my <a href="http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi?name=aymericg">life</a>!</em>'</p>
