<p>According to this BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/business/6163700.stm">report</a>, the UK economy is losing billions to those Nigerian scams. Even though I don't need to explain which scams to those of you who read this - they are proverbial - there are unspeakably avaricious and&nbsp;gullible cretins out there who still send their money into the Nigerian black economy.</p>
<p>I suppose if these people are&nbsp;moronic enough to think that the son/daughter of the Nigerian Mister for transport/embezzlement/finance&nbsp; would single them out from the billions of other candidates to share their booty with, then they deserve what they get.</p>
<p>Besides, it's more sociable than playing on slot machines, or having your mobile stolen - you get to exchange emails with these nice but desperate scions of once great African families.</p>
