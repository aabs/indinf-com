<p>Forgive the recent silence - I've been in my shed.

<p>Frequently, I need some variation on the Visitor or HierarchicalVisitor patterns
    to analyse or transform an object graph. Recent work on a query builder
    for an old-skool query API sent my thoughts once again to the Visitor pattern. I
    normally hand roll these frameworks based on my experiences with recursive
    descent compilers, but this time I thought I'd produce a more GoF-compliant
    implementation.

    <p>
The standard implementation of the visitor looks a lot like the first code example. First you
    define some sort of domain model (often following the composite pattern).
    This illustration doesn't bother with composite. I'll show one later on, with an
    accompanying HierarchicalVisitor implementation.


<p>{% highlight csharp %}
abstract class BaseElement {
      void Accept(IVisitor v);
    }
   class T1 : BaseElement {
         void Accept(IVisitor v) {
               v.visit(this);
         }
   }
   class T2 : BaseElement {
         void Accept(IVisitor v) {
               v.visit(this);
         }
   }
   class T3 : BaseElement {
         void Accept(IVisitor v) {
               v.visit(this);
         }
   }
   {% endhighlight %}

   <p>   {% highlight csharp %}
   interface IVisitor{
         void Visit (T1 t1);
         void Visit (T2 t2);
         void Visit (T3 t3);
   }
   {% endhighlight %}

   <p>
Here's an implementation of the visitor, normally you'd give default
    implementations via and abstract base class. I'll show how that's done later.


<p>{% highlight csharp %}
class MyVisitor : IVisitor {
      void Visit (T1 t1) {
            // do something here
      }
      void Visit (T2 t2) {
            // do something here
      }
      void Visit (T3 t3) {
            // do something here
      }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The accept methods are on the domain model entities themselves. What if I have a
    composite graph of objects that are not conveniently derived from some abstract
    class or interface for my convenience? What if I want to iterate or navigate
    the structures in alternate ways. What if I don't want to (or can't) pollute
    my domain model with visitation code?

    <p>
I thought it might be cleaner to factor out the responsibility for the
    dispatching into another class - a Dispatcher. I provide the Dispatcher from my
    client code and am still able to visit each element in turn. Surprisingly, the
    result is slightly cleaner than the standard implementation of the pattern,
    sacrificing nothing, but gaining a small increment in applicability.

    <p>
Let's contrast this canonical implementation with one that uses anemic objects
    for the domain model. First we need to define a little composite pattern to
    iterate over. This time, I'll give the abstract base class for the entities
    and for the visitors and show a composite pattern as well.


<p>{% highlight csharp %}
abstract class AbstractBase {
      public string Name {get;set;}
}
class Composite : AbstractBase {
      public string NonTerminalIdentifier { get; set; }
      public Composite(string nonTerminalIdentifier) {
            Name = "Composite";
            NonTerminalIdentifier = nonTerminalIdentifier;
      }
      public List SubParts = new List();
}
class Primitive1 : AbstractBase {
      public Primitive1() {
            Name = "Primitive1";
      }
}
class Primitive2 : AbstractBase {
      public Primitive2() {
            Name = "Primitive2";
      }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
A composite class plus a couple of primitives. Next, Lets look at the visitor
    interface.


<p>{% highlight csharp %}
interface IVisitor {
      void Visit(Primitive1 p1);
      void Visit(Primitive2 p2);
      bool StartVisit(Composite c);
      void EndVisit(Composite c);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
According to the discussions at the Portland pattern repository, this could be
    called the HierarchicalVisitor pattern, but I suspect most applications of
    visitor are over hierarchical object graphs, and they mostly end up like this so
    I won't dwell on the name too much. True to form, it provides mechanisms to
    visit each type of element allowed in our object graph. Next, the Dispatcher that
    controls the navigation over the object graph. This is the departure from the
    canonical model. A conventional implementation of visitor places this code in
    the composite model itself, which seems unnecessary. Accept overloads are
    provided for each type of the domain model.


<p>{% highlight csharp %}
class Dispatcher {
      public static void Accept(Primitive1 p1, TV visitor)
        where TV : IVisitor {
            visitor.Visit(p1);
      }
      public static void Accept(Primitive2 p2, TV visitor)
        where TV : IVisitor {
            visitor.Visit(p2);
      }
      public static void Accept(Composite c, TV visitor)
        where TV : IVisitor {
            if (visitor.StartVisit(c)) {
                  foreach (var subpart in c.SubParts) {
                        if (subpart is Primitive1) {
                              Accept(subpart as Primitive1, visitor);
                        }
                        else if (subpart is Primitive2) {
                              Accept(subpart as Primitive2, visitor);
                        }
                        else if (subpart is Composite) {
                              Accept(subpart as Composite, visitor);
                      }
                }
                visitor.EndVisit(c);
            }
      }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
The dispatcher's first parameter is the object graph element
    itself. This provides the context that was implicit with the conventional
    implementation. This is a trade-off. On the one hand you cannot access any
    private object information inside the dispatch code. On the other hand you can
    have multiple different dispatchers for different tasks. Another drawback with
    an 'external' dispatcher is the need for old-fashioned dispatcher switch
    statements in the Composite acceptor. The Composite stores its sub-parts as
    references to the AbstractBase class, so it needs to decide manually what the
    Accept method is that must handle the sub-part in question.

    <p>
The implementation for a visitor is much the same as in a normal implementation.
    A default implementation of the visit functions is given that
    does nothing. To implement a HierarchicalVisitor, the
    default StartVisit must return true to allow iteration of the
    subparts of a Composite to proceed.


<p>{% highlight csharp %}
class BaseVisitor : IVisitor {
      public virtual void Visit(Primitive1 p1) { }
      public virtual void Visit(Primitive2 p2) { }
      public virtual bool StartVisit(Composite c) {
            return true;
      }
      public virtual void EndVisit(Composite c) { }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Here's a Visitor that simply records the name of who gets visited.

<p>

<p>{% highlight csharp %}
class Visitor : BaseVisitor {
      public override void Visit(Primitive1 p1) {
            Debug.WriteLine("p1");
      }
      public override void Visit(Primitive2 p2) {
            Debug.WriteLine("p2");
      }
      public override bool StartVisit(Composite c) {
            Debug.WriteLine("->c");
            return true;
      }
      public override void EndVisit(Composite c) {
            Debug.WriteLine("<-c");
      }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
Given an object graph of type Composite, it is simple to use this little framework.

<p>

<p>{% highlight csharp %}
Dispatcher.Accept(objGraph, new Visitor1());
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I like this way of working with visitors more than the conventional
    implementation - it makes it possible to provide a good visitor implementation on
    thrid party frameworks (yes, I'm thinking of LINQ expression trees). It is no
    more expensive to extend with new visitors, and it has the virtue that you can
    navigate an object graph in any fashion you like.
