<p>When I get the time I intend to start off this blog by exploring the following ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing a design by contract system for C#</li>
<li>History of Design by Contract</li>
<li>Code Generation Systems XSLT vs NVelocity</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm producing a Design by contract system that's in early alpha. It uses NVelocity, and declarative programming. It lets you write code like this:<br />
<!-- code formatted by http://manoli.net/csharpformat/ --></p>
<pre>[Dbc, Invariant("Prop1 &gt;= 1")]     public class MyTestClass     {         public MyTestClass()         {         Prop1 = 10;         }         #region property Prop1         int prop1 = 0;         [Requires("value != 1561")]         public int Prop1         {             get             {                 return prop1;             }             set             {                 prop1 = value;             }         }         #endregion          [Requires("arg1 &gt; 10")]         [Requires("arg2 &lt; 100")]         [Ensures("$after(Prop1) == $before(Prop1) + 1")]         public void TestMethod(int arg1, int arg2, string arg3)         {             Prop1 = Prop1 + 1;             System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine( "MyTestClass.TestMethod.Prop1 == " + prop1.ToString());         }     }</pre>
<p>During the rest of the project I'll show you how I expand this system to work with Aspect Oriented Programming, and Static and Dynamic Proxies. I'll also explore the best ways of implementing the control logic under the hood.<br />
Till then, I guess we're stuck with Asserts or ifs at the beginning of methods.</p>
