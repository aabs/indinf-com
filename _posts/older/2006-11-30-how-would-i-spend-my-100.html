<p>Joe Duffy is busy at work writing a book about concurrency in .NET. He <a href="http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,20a3f9c3-c33b-4403-8598-ed943b578f25.aspx">asks</a> how we would spend our $100, given a choice from a set of topics available. Well, I'd have to spend mine like this:</p>
<p style="margin-left:36pt;">$5 - (0) Parallel algorithms (Comp Sci., technology agnostic)<br />$5 - (1) Architecting large scale concurrent programs<br />$5 - (2) Windows concurrency internals<br />$5 - (3) CLR concurrency internals<br />$5 - (4) Windows (Win32) concurrency API best practices<br />$5 - (5) CLR concurrency API best practices<br />$5 - (6) Client-side concurrency<br />$5 - (7) Server-side concurrency<br />$5 - (8) Reusable concurrency primitives (building and using them)<br />$5 - (9) Performance and scalability<br />$50 - (A) Debugging</p>
<p>And here's why. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><em>Because debugging concurrent systems is Ruddy Hard!!!!!</em></strong></span>  I wish I had $200 <span style="font-family:Wingdings;">J</span>
