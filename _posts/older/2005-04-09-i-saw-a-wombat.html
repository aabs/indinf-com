<p align="center"><em>The wombat lives across the seas,<br />
Among the far Antipodes.<br />
He may exist on nuts and berries,<br />
Or then again, on missionaries;<br />
His distant habitat precludes<br />
Conclusive knowledge of his moods.<br />
But I would not engage the wombat<br />
In any form of mortal combat.<br />
-- "The Wombat"<br />
</em></p>
<p>I saw something streak past my driveway the other night. It ran in a manner not unlike a chimp, or baboon - on all fours with a two-by-two gait. It was moving fast enough that it couldn't have been an escaping dwarf or baby. It had no tail, and was kind of compact. Needless to say I abstained from leaping after it into the dark, preferring to remain ignorant of the capabilities of your wombat in a fair fight.</p>
