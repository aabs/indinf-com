<p>... and in the first heats, Andrew won a resounding victory in the world <strong><em>tiddly-winks</em></strong> championships.</p>
<p>The sad part was it was Andrew Patocs, not Andrew Matthews, who wears the laurel wreath this evening. Andrew Matthews has spent the day in a darkened room wondering why he didn't admit defeat earlier.</p>
