<p>I'll be doing a short introduction on LINQ tonight at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.victoriadotnet.com.au/vic-victorianet-dev-sig-formed/vic-victorianet-dev-sig-events.aspx"><font color="#80ae14">Dev SIG of Victoria.NET</font></a> in Collins Street. I only have 20 minutes to talk so I won't be able to go into too much depth. What I do hope to do is persuade the audience that LINQ is worthy of their attention. If I can persuade a few people to go out and develop their own query providers, then even better.</p>
<p>It's an over capacity crowd, and they're not taking any more RSVPs. If you haven't booked yet, don't despair - I'm sure that there'll be more good stuff coming down the line.</p>
<p>Wish me luck - it's my first presentation for Victoria.NET.</p>
