<p>I&#39;ve always been a believer in the power of <i>good</i> advertising, which is why I was so pleased to see this fantastic example of the art in Melbourne this week. <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/929/1600/advert.jpg"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/advert.jpg" /></a> It has it all - it has the doleful situation of the foolish dolt who has so willfully left himself in a state of baldness that is, as we can see by the &quot;after&quot; photo, so obviously reversible. I salute this masterpiece of modern advertising, and hope that television advertisers can learn from it.</p>
