<p>Some time back I wrote&nbsp; a <a href="http://aabs.wordpress.com/2005/12/02/quote-of-the-day-3/" target="_blank">quote of the day</a>: <em>There is no greater joy than soaring high on the wings of your dreams, except maybe the joy of watching a dreamer who has nowhere to land but in the ocean of reality. </em>For a moment I though the quote was apropos for Alec Clew's announcement of his apostasy, but after a moment's reflection I realize that it's not.</p>
<p>Alec <a href="http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/i-might-have-to-go-back-to-the-dark-side/" target="_blank">wrote</a> the other day that, due to driver problems, he was thinking that he may have to depart the&nbsp;sunlit pastures&nbsp;of Gnu/Linux to return to the&nbsp;dreary halls&nbsp;of Windows XP. If you've noticed any of the&nbsp;censure I've directed towards Alec's perverse habits (disgusting admissions of Ubuntism and flagrantly exhibitionist&nbsp;open-sourcism)&nbsp;over the last year, then you might think that there would be a spiteful little gleam in my eye. But I have admit I'm saddened. We are nearly at a point where we can perform painless .NET development entirely within a Gnu/Linux environment. It would be a sad thing if that were not possible because of hardware support shortcomings, rather than the quality of the toolset (which should be the only deciding factor).</p>
