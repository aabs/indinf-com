<p>I have set up the sourceforge project. You can find it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aabsnorm/">here</a>. I&#39;ve also classified all of the work, and split it up into releases.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what will go into release one:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Configuration</td>
<td>Use native .NET configuration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Configuration</td>
<td>Remove existing config assembly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Installers</td>
<td>WIX installers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime Control</td>
<td>Add transactional support from COM+</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime Control</td>
<td>Extend reverse engineering to examine SPs and create wrappers for them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime Control</td>
<td>Configurable ID strategy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime Control</td>
<td>Configurable transaction isolation policy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Templates</td>
<td>Move core templates into resource assembly</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Testing</td>
<td>Create a proper test database</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime Control</td>
<td>Divide system between runtime and development projects</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Runtime Control</td>
<td>Standardise all names to CamelCase</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I think the highest priority is the configuration rework. Configuration in the previous system was way too complicated. What we need is a very simple, very reliable system that can easily be expanded to accommodate something like the config app block at a later date. As soon as that is done, the key task will be converting it from its current broken state to a working state, and then splitting the system up into runtime and development arms. I will also do some work towards creating WIX installers for the runtime and development systems, including an installer for packaging source releases, that will allow the easy setup of a development environment for new volunteers on the project.</p>
<p>This is of course based on the &quot;<em>if you build it, they will come</em>&quot; model of open source development.</p>
