<p>I love to be educated. I also love the fact that I can absorb new ideas continuously without ever sating my thirst for data. And where better than at Wikipedia, which has obviously been lavished with the attentions of a database expert in recent days. I have to admit that I have never heard of, let alone worked on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_database">dimensional database</a>, so I am intrigued to know more.</p>
