[Child LinguisticÂ Development](http://aabs.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/childlinguisticdevelopment.pdf) is a document that I wrote when I was at university on the stages of language development.

I'd forgotten most of this stuff, so it will make interesting reading for me too! I've put a link in to kerry's gorgeous new blog/journal, where she describes her day-to-day experiences of raising twins. Hair raising more than twin raising, if you want my opinion...
