<p>Well, <strong><em>Aabs Dbc</em></strong> is now out there in the public domain now. Yayyy!!!!!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve created an open-source project on sourceforge, and advertised there for help with documentation, installers and general app developers. I&#39;ve uploaded an initial source code release - and configured my paypal settings.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t wait to see how it is received by the public. Pay the site a visit, and let me know what YOU think. And, of course, if you want to make a donation... ;o)</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aabsdbc/">SourceForge</a> link.</p>
