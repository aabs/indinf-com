<p>Troy Magennis has <a href="http://aspiring-technology.com/blogs/troym/archive/2006/12/28/77.aspx">launched</a> a wiki for LINQ, called <a href="http://www.hookedonlinq.com/MainPage.ashx">Hooked on LINQ</a>.</p>
<p>Please visit it, and enrich it! It might become a great source of information in the future, but only if we use it now. At the moment it needs content, and if you have written on the topic, please go there and at the very least link back to what you have written.</p>
