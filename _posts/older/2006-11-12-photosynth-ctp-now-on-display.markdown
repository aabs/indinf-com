Live Labs has now put Photosynth on display to the public. You can't add your own photos yet, but the interface is everything that they promised. I can't wait to be able to use this on my own photos.

I think it will change the way I use my camera. With this interface I will still have to compose pictures that stand alone, since each picture is rendered alone on the screen. But I will be much more inclined to randomly shoot around me to try to ensure I have an overlapping montage ready for when photosynth is available on the desktop (assuming it will be). Currently it is only available as an ActiveX control for use in a browser. Does that mean that the control is to link you to images stored centrally? Is this the product that MS hopes will draw people away from Flickr to a service of their own? I hope not. I want this to replace Canon ZoomBrowser EX as the way I get to my images in future.
