<p>I received a very heart-rending letter today from a lady whose email is helenamed@i12.com (yes spiders, please use it) who needs my help. As a renowned Charitable Organisation I am now the first port of call for all such desperate people who, ridden with cancer and sadly widowed from a rich, industrious and virtuous husbands, need to transfer money out of accounts that work in very strange ways. I am ever glad to be of assistance to the rich and needy worldwide, and to do that I still need your donations readers. So please keep on sending the money.</p>
