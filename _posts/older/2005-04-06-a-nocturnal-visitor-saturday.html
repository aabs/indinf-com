<p>We had a visitor the other night. A Ring-tailed Possum. This little fellow has been creeping around on our roof lately. That wouldn't bother me too much except for the fact that we have a tin roof, and he has sharp clicky little claws.</p>

<p>Beautiful looking creatures though. And we shall have to keep a supply of bananas around the house. Maybe we can domesticate him...</p>
