I did a quick search on the new Google trends service, for the word 'algorithm'.

The top 6 cities out of the top 10, were in india.

Perhaps I should move to India. they get to use algorithms there!

Either way, it seems that that would be a fair indicator of the fact that western developers are writing less low level code than the indians? Either that or the india programmers need to refer to the web for help more often. Which do you think it is?
