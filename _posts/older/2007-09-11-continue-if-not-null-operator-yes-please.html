<p><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/User/Profile.aspx?UserID=695544&amp;SiteID=1">Olmo</a> made a very worthwhile <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2033762&amp;SiteID=1">suggestion </a>on the LINQ forums recently. His suggestion was for a new operator to be added to the C# language to allow us to do away with the following kind of pesky construct:</p>
<pre></pre>
<pre>
</pre>
<pre> [sourcecode language='csharp']string x;
if(a != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.Address != null &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a.Address.FirstLine != null)
    x = a.Address.FirstLine;[/sourcecode]</pre>
<p>instead he suggested a new <strong>?.</strong> operator so that we could produce something like this:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<pre> [sourcecode language='csharp']x = a?.Address?.FirstLine;[/sourcecode]</pre>
<p>and at the first sign of failure it would just yield a null or the equivalent. I like this suggestion, it is elegant, and provides a similar meaning to the coalescing operator.  The C# team have been adding lots of these little bits of syntactic sugar recently, so why not add another that will save us lots of thrown exceptions or grisly if statements?</p>
