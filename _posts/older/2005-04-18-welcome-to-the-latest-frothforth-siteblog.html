<p>Consider this a joint opportunity to insert a lot of oblique strokes into a title and to resurrect nostalgically the <strong><em>good old days of spleen</em></strong>. What I expect is that this site will fill up with more and more expostulations of frustration and cataclisms of gleeful creativity. <em>You won't know whether to laugh, cry or puke</em>.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that you do all of the above; but in textual format and in this forum. reply to any of the posts to request posting permission for this site. Membership is confined to those who can demonstrate a proven ability to complain bitterly about the stupidity, ignorance or naivety of others or to those who have ideas that are not appreciated by stupid, ignorant or naive people.</p>
