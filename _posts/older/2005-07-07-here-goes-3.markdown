I have taken this stuff to the point where it is not too scruffy to release to the world. What I need to do now is publicise it to the world at large. Any ideas about the best forums for that?
I think SourceForgeand gotdotnet will help, but I can also imagine that sharptools and USENET might be good avenues to publicise it through. How will I manage the project when I open the code up to the open source community?

The SourceForge project location is [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/aabsdbc/).
The GotDotNet project location is [here](http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=24fe7e5d-e342-4ad9-a749-8048020f2828).
