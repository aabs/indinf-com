Have any of these wishes become obsolete in the last 8 years?



	
  * Eradicate typographical errors from the development process.

	
  * Remove source code from the development process.

	
  * Move the emphasis of the development process from coding to design.

	
  * Make the development process a visual rather than linguistic one.

	
  * Move maintenance from code to design.

	
  * Make debugging easy

	
  * Make designs directly executable

	
  * Make viewing levels of abstraction easy.

	
  * Make moving from one level of abstraction to aqnother easy.

	
  * Make development using design patterns easy.

	
  * Enable collaborative design and development easy.

	
  * Allow context sensitive viewing possible using programming user profiles.

	
  * Enable something VR telepresence. Allow user definable representation of inter-entity relationships.

	
  * Allow vocal annotation of designs.

	
  * Infinitely expandable application architecture. Allow user modification and enhancement of the application architecture.

	
  * Platform independence.

	
  * Make IDE adaptable to your style of thinking/coding and let it produce a PUP for you.

	
  * Make standards, spec and protocols easy to produce and use to control the design process.

	
  * Make the protocols/specs etc easy to analyse.

	
  * Promote formal methods and provable designs.

	
  * Allow the optimisation of code. Ie the production of fast code.

	
  * Enable the uniform representstion of all types as classes.

	
  * Define the "type" that you wish to use by defining its type rather than defining it name.
