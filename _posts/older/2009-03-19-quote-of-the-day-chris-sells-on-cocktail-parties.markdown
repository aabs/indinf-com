I can relate to [this](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2260):


<blockquote>I'll take a lake of fire any day over more than three strangers in a room with which I share no common task and with whom I'm expected to socialize</blockquote>


How to express this to my wife without her thinking that I am suffering from a combination of acrophobia and Downs Syndrome...?

BTW: I was surfing Chris' blog because I've finally made the time to explore MGrammar and the "OSLO" SDK.

Expect to see a resurgance of blogging on this site, as I introduce you to my new open source project.

Expect to hear a bit about [MGrammar](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709420.aspx), [PEX](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Pex/), [F#](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/), [Powershell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell), and declarative architecture specifications...

... I'm excited. New toys to play with and some amazing new productivity enhancements to play with...
