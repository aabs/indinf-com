<p>Here is a simple experiment that will teach you an important electrical<br />
lesson: On a cool, dry day, scuff your feet along a carpet, then reach your<br />
hand into a friend&#39;s mouth and touch one of his dental fillings.&nbsp; Did you<br />
notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in pain?&nbsp; This<br />
teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force, but we must never<br />
use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an important electrical lesson.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works.&nbsp; When you scuffed<br />
your feet, you picked up batches of &quot;electrons&quot;, which are very small objects<br />
that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will attract dirt.<br />
The electrons travel through your bloodstream and collect in your finger,<br />
where they form a spark that leaps to your friend&#39;s filling, then travels<br />
down to his feet and back into the carpet, thus completing the circuit.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without<br />
touching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your finger<br />
would explode!&nbsp; But this is nothing to worry about unless you have<br />
carpeting.<br />
