<p>Funny. There really is a large Oedipal component to anti-MS zealotry. The non-alpha nerds (especially very young under graduate level or recently post graduate level nerds) presumably see Bill Gates (and Microsoft in general) in the same way as they saw their fathers when they were very young children... Bill is the ultimate competitor for all that they desire in the world of their technical explorations (mother). If they cannot displace him and his organization from the affections of mother (the PC buying, technology using public) then they learn to sublimate their hatred of him into 500 word anti-MS blog posts on sites like slashdot.</p>
<p>So when you next read one of these /.esque diatribes, you can imagine a little boy throwing a tantrum because Mummy is talking to Daddy rather than playing with him instead.</p>
