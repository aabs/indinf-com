I took this photo a few weeks ago. Kerry still keeps on growing. She's already bigger than some of her friends when they were at full term. It's getting a bit uncomfortable for her now. I'm spending a lot of time giving her foot rubs now! Not that I mind - she has perfect feet, or at least that's what she keeps telling me. ;^}
