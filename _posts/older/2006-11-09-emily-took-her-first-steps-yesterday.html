<p>I am so proud of my little angel. She walked a full circuit around her room without any help. It freaked her out a little bit. Especially after she fell over and gave her head a nasty thump.  As predicted, she has leapfrogged over the walking stage altogether: She went straight to robotics dancing.</p>
