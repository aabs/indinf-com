We got ourselves the Canon PowershotPro1 in readiness for the big day (so that we can preserve the gore in glorious technicolour for all time). It's a (as the Aussies would say) Beaut! Expect to see quite a few landscape and macro photos appearing here in the near future.</p>

The overall conclusion from DPReview was that it was a good canmera, with one or two minor problems relating to speed, but it got a Recommended status.</p>
