<p>I am getting rid of these damn delicious links. They are making my blogging output seem a little sparse. Besides, why not just subscribe to the RSS link at delicious if you want to know what I&#39;m finding? Or better still, send me your delicious id and what you are interested in, and I will send them to you as I find them?</p>
