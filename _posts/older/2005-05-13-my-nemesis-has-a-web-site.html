<p>Apart from being my nemesis and the person I am most often mistaken for, he is a pretty good portrait photographer and is in residence that the Brighton Festival this year.</p>
<p>My favourite picture is over on the far right:- Jeff Noon, the only author to have rendered me unconscious just with the sound of his voice.</p>
<p>So, have any of this blog's Brightonian readers (the REAL Brighton that is) been to any of the shows? Reply to this with your thoughts. I thought last year's effort was a little pale - <em>No fireworks for god's sake!</em></p>
