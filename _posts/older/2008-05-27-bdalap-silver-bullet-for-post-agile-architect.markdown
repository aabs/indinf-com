Software svengali [Alec Clews](http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/) has recently [delineated](http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/2008/05/27/my-new-software-engineering-methodology-bdalap/) a methodology that brings together the best of both the Agile and Waterfall worlds into a single edible package that will keep us in work for years to come. The methodological guru said "_BDALAP recognises that certain design decisions are a) complex and b) have far reaching implications_". The solution, he says, is to perform Big Design As Late As Possible. 

Of course, an Agile exponent would say that "_as late as possible_" would be when the application proves not to scale. A waterfall exponent would disagree, saying that "_as late as possible_" is before anyone even thought of the project.

I applaud the triumph of common sense that tries to place Design somewhere in between.

Alec - can I sign up to become the first (or is that second?) antipodean "BDALAP Master"?
