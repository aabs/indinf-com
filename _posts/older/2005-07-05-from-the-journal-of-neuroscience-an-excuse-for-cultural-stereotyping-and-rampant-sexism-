It says here: "_in the absence of nuclear receptor 2E1 (NR2E1), even laboratory mice can become fierce, displaying pathological violent behavior_ ".

It's now obvious that the UK government has been manufacturing an NR2E1 suppressant for years and releasing it into the water supplies of council estates and spiking Stella Artois with it.

Do women undergo a drop in the levels of NR2E1 every month? [_It's just a joke, alright!_]

Presumably excess levels of NR2E1 can have the opposite effect? Whatever the truth is, I don't want an argument. OK?
