<p>Finding that we didn&#39;t have room for a drying machine, and figuring that Melbourne summers are long and hot and dry, we decided that a clothes horse or two would be a better short term investment. And, keen as she is, Kerry decided to give one a try.</p>

<p>It gives me the shivers - I see a future littered with drying stinky babies romper suits. Our neat and minimalist, and even quite stylishly modern on a good day, existence is about to become very biological. Not that I mind - I also see myself becoming virtually American in my capacity for maudlin sentimentality about fatherhood.</p>
<p>Like I said - very biological.</p>
