<p>...life is pain.</p>
<p>And it seems that some of us (and I&#39;m including myself in this camp till proven otherwise) are born with an inherited tendency to feel more pain than others. This curse is known as &quot;<em>primary erythromelalgia</em>&quot;. And is somehow related to a defective sodium channel in the pain signalling neurons. I blame my parents.</p>

<h4>Breaking news</h4>
<p>It seems that one of the guys that I&#39;m working with has a father-in-law who was a body guard for Adolph Hitler. A nasty bast*rd by all accounts.</p>
