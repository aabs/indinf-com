<p>Does one experience nose bleeds when suffering from CJD?</p>
<p>The report says "<em>raw materials for fertiliser and feed imported from the Indian subcontinent in the 60s and 70s contained human bones and soft tissue</em>".</p>
<p>So indirectly we were performing acts of cannibalism when we were eating beef. Where does that place the relationship between cows and humans? We are eating them and they are eating us? Who is higher on the food chain?</p>
