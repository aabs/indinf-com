<p>For the edification of the collective attentionstream, I have decided to quote for you the ineffable value additions and polysyllabic formulations of the "<em>System One" </em>post-microchunked formats - with a translation.</p>
<p>"<em>Our </em><a href="http://www.systemone.at/en/services/"><em>services</em></a><em> strategically develop your organization's knowledge as a production factor in order to make optimal use of it. The core of our service portfolio is a </em><a href="http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/overview/"><em>technological platform</em></a><em>,   that consistently makes available innovations in the areas of </em><a href="http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/socialsoftware/"><em>Social Software</em></a><em>,  </em><a href="http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/semweb/"><em>Semantic Web</em></a><em>  and  </em><a href="http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/ai/"><em>Information Retrieval</em></a><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly groundbreaking stuff. In case you didn't catch it the first time round: "<em>we've got a website. You can use it. People can read it.</em>"</p>
<p>Awesome. Really.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's french - they first brought us post-modernist analysis, and now they have brought us post-technological production factors.</p>
