A new [study](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-mdm102506.php), just released, indicates that social-drinking lab rats have improved memories over those that do not. Researchers hung out in the same bars as the rats, asking them probing questions after nights on the townbench?

As an Englishman, I have been known to indulge, or even overindulge, in the past. But for some reason, that I can't fathom, over the last year or two I have stopped drinking. Perhaps I just forgot to... do whatever it was we were talking about.
