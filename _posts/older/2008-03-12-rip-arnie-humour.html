<p>My blogging has been pretty sporadic of late. My evenings have been spent working on a long SPARQL tutorial for IBM. It's just going through the last editorial reviews now (with the good folks at <a href="http://www.backstopmedia.com/" target="_blank">Backstop Media</a>) and should be published in a day or two.</p>
<p><a href="http://aabs.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/image.png"><img style="border-width:0;" border="0" alt="image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image-thumb.png" width="528" /></a> </p>
<p>Bob and Troy at Backstop are great editors, and their suggestions have kept the tutorial focused and much easier to understand. But I just had to find somewhere to put this snippet that they've asked me to cut. I know it's unrelated to the tutorial, but it made me laugh.</p>
<blockquote><p>Arnie fans will know that, when presented with this question, it's wise to lie. Joseki is faithful to a fault.</p>
<pre>PREFIX u: &lt;http://purl.org/net/aabs/ont/users#&gt;</pre>
<pre> </pre>
<pre>ASK</pre>
<pre>{</pre>
<pre>&nbsp; ?x u:displayName "Sarah Connor".</pre>
<pre>}</pre>
<p>Let's just hope that Joseki wasn't planning on spending the evening in with her boyfriend: </p>
<p><code>ASK =&gt; true</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let this be the last resting place of my daft attempts to make SPARQL funny.</p>
