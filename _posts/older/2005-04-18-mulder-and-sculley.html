<p>Just when we thought we were on the way to a new age of enlightenment and reason, along comes the X-files and makes gullibility fashionable again.</p>
<p>The truth is always available. Choosing not to believe the truth when the truth is obvious or verifiable is intellectual suicide. Just because Mulder and Scully are snappy dressers, good-looking seekers after the improbable truth that is "out there," we must all follow suite. We must do it while having our colons irrigated in our own personal, natural, organic floatation tanks. Moreover, we must do it with dreadlocks.</p>
