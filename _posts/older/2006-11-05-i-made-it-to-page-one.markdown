It's taken a long time, and nearly 300 blog posts (and probably a cross link or two from [Mitch](http://notgartner.wordpress.com) whose site stats make me very envious) But "The Wandering Glitch" has finally made its way to the first page of Google results for searches on "_Andrew Matthews_" which considering how common the name is made me very happy. I sit behind my namesake, who is the artist and author of the excellent book "Being Happy". I can live with that.

I doubt you'd find me if you did a search for C# or Computer Science though. So I'll keep going...

Anyway, thanks for reading the blog! I hope you enjoy the content. Let me know which topics interest you most.
