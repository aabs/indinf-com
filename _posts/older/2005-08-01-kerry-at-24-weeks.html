<p>I took this photo a few weeks ago. Kerry still keeps on growing. She&#39;s already bigger than some of her friends when they were at full term. It&#39;s getting a bit uncomfortable for her now. I&#39;m spending a lot of time giving her foot rubs now! Not that I mind - she has perfect feet, or at least that&#39;s what she keeps telling me. ;^}</p>
