<p>This site is entertaining in the same way that nonsense poetry is. It is ingenious, and its obvious that a great deal of effort has been put into it, but it is not intended to make any sense. I am also bowled over by how powerful the memes are to be able to force these people into expending that much effort in the pursuit of the arguments. I&#39;ve seen the poor souls compelled out into the rain on a Saturday morning to spread the word, despite the fact that these (seemingly respectable) people are being rained on as well as showered with the contempt of their fellow men.</p>
<p>That driving compulsion is such a terrible thing in the hands of unscrupulous men. Woe betide us (forgive the slip into biblical grammar) if someone were to ever find a way to master the memetic manipulation and infection of the populace. The human mind would be the battleground for a war of ideas. <em><strong>Now hold on, I know what you&#39;re thinking. That&#39;s the whole of human history. </strong></em></p>
<p>I guess we are walking around in the rubble of a Stalingrad of the mind. And the visitors on the flat-earth society web site are the dead and walking wounded. I think that Derek wants to be a stretcher bearer. And as you can see, dear reader, I want to be a war poet. Sadly I lost my pencil, so I shall settle for being a innocent bystander caught in the crossfire, but hoping that the allies will liberate me from a world of doxological propoganda (and hyperbole).</p>
