It appears that Boo has [reincarnated](http://yoick.wordpress.com/2006/11/25/yoick-wotf-boo-2-to-launch/) to drag us down, once again. Of course, it won't be possible without the help of Aggy Finn who was with them at the time*.

If the contractor wages go down to 10GBP/hr again, Aggy, I shall be blaming you!!!!!


* Needless to say, most this is a pack of lies. Especially the bit about Aggy being responsible.
