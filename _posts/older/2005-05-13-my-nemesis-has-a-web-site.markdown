Apart from being my nemesis and the person I am most often mistaken for, he is a pretty good portrait photographer and is in residence that the Brighton Festival this year.

My favourite picture is over on the far right:- Jeff Noon, the only author to have rendered me unconscious just with the sound of his voice.

So, have any of this blog's Brightonian readers (the REAL Brighton that is) been to any of the shows? Reply to this with your thoughts. I thought last year's effort was a little pale - _No fireworks for god's sake!_
