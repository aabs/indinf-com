Consider this a joint opportunity to insert a lot of oblique strokes into a title and to resurrect nostalgically the **_good old days of spleen_**. What I expect is that this site will fill up with more and more expostulations of frustration and cataclisms of gleeful creativity. _You won't know whether to laugh, cry or puke_.

My suggestion is that you do all of the above; but in textual format and in this forum. reply to any of the posts to request posting permission for this site. Membership is confined to those who can demonstrate a proven ability to complain bitterly about the stupidity, ignorance or naivety of others or to those who have ideas that are not appreciated by stupid, ignorant or naive people.
