<p><a href="http://www.devsource.com/cp/bio/John-Paul-Mueller/">John Mueller</a> recently sent through a link to a series of articles on working with RDF. As well as being a useful introduction to working with RDF, they use LinqToRdf for code examples.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Architecture/Modeling-with-RDF-Part-1/">Modeling your Data with RDF (Part 1)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Architecture/Using-Resource-Description-Framework-Files/">Understanding and Using Resource Description Framework Files (Part 2)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They provide information on hosting RDF files as well as querying them using LinqToRdf. They show how easy it is to get semantic web applications up and running on .NET in no time at all. Please read the articles and share the links around.</p>
<p>John also told me about his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470277947/datacservip0f-20/">LINQ for Dummies</a>, which has a section on LinqToRdf. I've not had a chance to read it yet. I would welcome any feedback, which I'll pass through to John. I understand that the content is broadly similar to the articles on DevSource.com, placing more emphasis on LINQ than RDF.  Again, please take a look and let me know what you think.</p>
