Like a faithless lover, I went off to sample the market of feed aggregators - I was off having a fling with Omea Reader, , leaving SharpReader to languish in a distant directory of rejection. Omea was new and exciting, but sadly was a little bit slow. Pity really, because Omea is produced by Jetbrains, makers of the indispensible Resharper, without which my life would be a barren waste of multiple edits.

So, like a thief in the night I have come slinking back to SharpReader, with my tail between my legs.

If you need a rich feed of unspeakable mixed metaphors, you could do worse than looking to SharpReader, for your daily fire hose.
