<p>"<i>I find the whole orientation of the heavens to be contrary to all that I've known as true</i>".</p>
<p>So said <i><b>Andrew Matthews</b></i>, at a recent conference of the cognescenti. He went on to add that the orientation and movement of the heavens in the antipodes is exactly the opposite of what is found in the northern hemisphere, and that he is the first to recognise this fact and to talk about it.</p>
