I've always been a believer in the power of _good_ advertising, which is why I was so pleased to see this fantastic example of the art in Melbourne this week. [![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/929/320/advert.jpg)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/929/1600/advert.jpg) It has it all - it has the doleful situation of the foolish dolt who has so willfully left himself in a state of baldness that is, as we can see by the "after" photo, so obviously reversible. I salute this masterpiece of modern advertising, and hope that television advertisers can learn from it.
