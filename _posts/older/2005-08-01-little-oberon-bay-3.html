<p>This is little oberon bay on Wilson&#39;s Prom. Taki and I went there at the start of the year. It is sooo gorgeous to look at in this photo, and despite the fact that the temperature was up above 30C the water was bitterly cold and we couldn&#39;t cope for long.</p>
<p>I think it may have had something to do with the fact that there was only open water between us and Antarctica. Either way, it was easy on the eye.</p>
<p>This BTW is a test post from Flickr</p>
