The graph below I found from a recruitment site. It lists the relative importance of programming language skills and how they have changed over the last few years.

Aside from the fact that C# isn't even in there, which I find a little alarming, it shows that all of the languages listed are in decline. Especially my beloved C++, king of all languages. Does this graph indicate that there is a proliferation of languages and that the impact of previously major languages is being diluted.

Are we building a babel tower of scripting languages, that will come tumbling down around our ears? Perhaps this was foreseen by Microsoft and motivated them to target language independence of the .NET platform rather than platform independence as was the case with Java?
