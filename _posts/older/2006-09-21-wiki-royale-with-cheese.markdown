For the edification of the collective attentionstream, I have decided to quote for you the ineffable value additions and polysyllabic formulations of the "_System One" _post-microchunked formats - with a translation.

"_Our _[_services_](http://www.systemone.at/en/services/)_ strategically develop your organization's knowledge as a production factor in order to make optimal use of it. The core of our service portfolio is a _[_technological platform_](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/overview/)_,   that consistently makes available innovations in the areas of _[_Social Software_](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/socialsoftware/)_,  _[_Semantic Web_](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/semweb/)_  and  _[_Information Retrieval_](http://www.systemone.at/en/technology/ai/)_._"

This is undoubtedly groundbreaking stuff. In case you didn't catch it the first time round: "_we've got a website. You can use it. People can read it._"

Awesome. Really.

Needless to say, it's french - they first brought us post-modernist analysis, and now they have brought us post-technological production factors.
