<p>Well, not quite firstborn yet - but we are now into the second trimester so things are going to be more stable from now on! First official diagnosis on the status of the twins indicates that they are in fact - jumping beans... You can tell that <em>baby 2 </em>takes after her mother.</p>
<p>Codenamed baby 1 and baby 2 prior to launch.</p>
