<p>Have any of these wishes become obsolete in the last 8 years?</p>
<ul>
<li>Eradicate typographical errors from the development process.</li>
<li>Remove source code from the development process.</li>
<li>Move the emphasis of the development process from coding to design.</li>
<li>Make the development process a visual rather than linguistic one.</li>
<li>Move maintenance from code to design.</li>
<li>Make debugging easy</li>
<li>Make designs directly executable</li>
<li>Make viewing levels of abstraction easy.</li>
<li>Make moving from one level of abstraction to aqnother easy.</li>
<li>Make development using design patterns easy.</li>
<li>Enable collaborative design and development easy.</li>
<li>Allow context sensitive viewing possible using programming user profiles.</li>
<li>Enable something VR telepresence. Allow user definable representation of inter-entity relationships.</li>
<li>Allow vocal annotation of designs.</li>
<li>Infinitely expandable application architecture. Allow user modification and enhancement of the application architecture.</li>
<li>Platform independence.</li>
<li>Make IDE adaptable to your style of thinking/coding and let it produce a PUP for you.</li>
<li>Make standards, spec and protocols easy to produce and use to control the design process.</li>
<li>Make the protocols/specs etc easy to analyse.</li>
<li>Promote formal methods and provable designs.</li>
<li>Allow the optimisation of code. Ie the production of fast code.</li>
<li>Enable the uniform representstion of all types as classes.</li>
<li>Define the "type" that you wish to use by defining its type rather than defining it name.</li>
</ul>
