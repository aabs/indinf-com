<p>Well there is so much to write about, that I thought it was about time I jumped onto the wagon, and told the world what's going on in my life, and in my head. As the saying goes, the more that things change, the more they stay the same. And that's certainly been true for me during the last few years. Change is the only constrant in my life lately (except for Kerry - Oh, and Mosquitoes).</p>
<p>But more on that later. Anyway, welcome to my blog. Please syndicate it. I recommend <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">http://www.sharpreader.net/</a> as the best I've found so far.</p>
<p>Later I'll publish my OPML exports. You can see what news I'm interested in. Maybe you will be too, provided you have an unhealthy interest in .NET coding gizmos and the latest fads in UK politics.</p>
