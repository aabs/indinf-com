<p><a href="http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/first.php">http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/first.php</a>&nbsp;is a site of computer science and algorithmics problems that are published by the ACM. There are some very interesting problems in here. I haven&#39;t taken a look at any of the solutions, but this could be a very useful resource.</p>
