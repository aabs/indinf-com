<p>Paul Stovell has written a <a href="http://www.paulstovell.net/blog/index.php/we-are-what-we-repeatedly-code/">good post</a> calling for people to make writing good code a habit they employ every day.</p>
<p>Think of it as like going to work in dirty underwear. What would your mother think if you were run over in the street, and they found you had been doing Agile?</p>
