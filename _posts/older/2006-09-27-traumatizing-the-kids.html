<p>I knew I'd have to watch my tongue when the kids were old enough to be warped by my cynicism. What I didn't realize was that I'd have to watch my nose as well.  I think I may have traumatized Thomas' the other day - I've convinced him that Daddy's head may explode without warning.</p>
<p>It was during bath-time. I covered my face in bubbles which they both thought was hilarious, if a bit strange. The hilarity turned to horror when I blew the bubbles off my face with a big puff. Bubbles went everywhere, which I thought would also yield giggles. Instead Thomas gave  out a blood-curdling scream and was inconsolable till I wiped the rest of the bubbles off my face and showed him that I hadn't self-combusted.</p>
<p>Poor Sod. Now he thinks that faces are explosive, and probably thinks it will happen to him as well.</p>
