<div><a href="http://www.SemanticOverflow.com">www.SemanticOverflow.com</a> is a new site based on the hugely popular StackOverflow.com, devoted to Q&amp;A on anything related to the semantic web. The site is very new (created today) and I'm trying to get as many people to visit as I can, so please come and post your questions and together we'll create a thriving community dedicated just to the semantic web. It's free to join, free to ask questions, and most important of all - free to see the answers. You don't even have to sign up to view, ask or answer questions. If you do join, all you get is kudos.</div>
<div></div>
<div>StackOverflow has been an overnight sensation because it combines many of the traditional features of wikis, newgroups and social media platforms combined with a reputation system that promotes community involvement and high quality discussion. I'm sure that as the Semantic Web starts to go exponential, Semantic Overflow will be a useful forum for more than just technical questions. I hope you'll use it for speculation about the directions of the field itself. Unlike StackOverflow, non-technical discussions won't be moderated out, provided they are on-topic. I think that in such an interesting and emerging space, discussion and dissemination of knowledge is critical. If you agree, please come and join us for a question or two.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Please also tell your friends, colleagues, relatives, acquaintances, pets and neighbors and ask them all to visit the site. If you have any suggestions about other places I could promote the site in - feel free to provide an answer <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/1/where-can-i-learn-about-the-semantic-web">here</a>.</div>
