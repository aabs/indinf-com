<p>WOW!!!</p>
<p>David Emonin is playing on ETN.FM, and his music is about the only trance music I have heard in years that actually does put me into a trance. I could listen to his set for days!!!<br />
There will hopefully be a BitTorrent to download after the set.</p>
<p>Stream name: ETN.FM Progressive Channel<br />
Current title: David Emonin - Atmospheres (Prog Edition) 005 - 16-04-2005</p>
