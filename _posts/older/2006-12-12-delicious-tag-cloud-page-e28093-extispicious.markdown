While I was out trawling the web, I came upon [extisp.ico.us](http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi?name=aabs) – an extremely cool little CGI app to render a tag cloud of a user's public links in del.icio.us.


Check it out on a friend's collection – it gives you an insight into their mind. As Aymeric, who sits beside me, said when he saw his links: '_zis is like looking at my [life](http://kevan.org/extispicious.cgi?name=aymericg)!_'
