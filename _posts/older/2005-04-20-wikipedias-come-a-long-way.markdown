I just followed a link from [slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org) to take a glance at Wikipedia. This is a public domain, publicly editable, peer-reviewed encyclopedia. And goddam is it good these days. It's been a while since I last went therre, and it was good at the time, but since then it has grown and grown, and edged past some of the other similar projects. It has around 533,000 entries, and if [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics) is representative, then I think that Brittanica and Encarta are soon to be out of business.
