WOW!!!

David Emonin is playing on ETN.FM, and his music is about the only trance music I have heard in years that actually does put me into a trance. I could listen to his set for days!!!
There will hopefully be a BitTorrent to download after the set.

Stream name: ETN.FM Progressive Channel
Current title: David Emonin - Atmospheres (Prog Edition) 005 - 16-04-2005
