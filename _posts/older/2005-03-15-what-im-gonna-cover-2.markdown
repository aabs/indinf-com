When I get the time I intend to start off this blog by exploring the following ideas:



	
  * Developing a design by contract system for C#

	
  * History of Design by Contract

	
  * Code Generation Systems XSLT vs NVelocity


I'm producing a Design by contract system that's in early alpha. It uses NVelocity, and declarative programming. It lets you write code like this:


    
    [Dbc, Invariant("Prop1 >= 1")]     public class MyTestClass     {         public MyTestClass()         {         Prop1 = 10;         }         #region property Prop1         int prop1 = 0;         [Requires("value != 1561")]         public int Prop1         {             get             {                 return prop1;             }             set             {                 prop1 = value;             }         }         #endregion          [Requires("arg1 > 10")]         [Requires("arg2 < 100")]         [Ensures("$after(Prop1) == $before(Prop1) + 1")]         public void TestMethod(int arg1, int arg2, string arg3)         {             Prop1 = Prop1 + 1;             System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine( "MyTestClass.TestMethod.Prop1 == " + prop1.ToString());         }     }


During the rest of the project I'll show you how I expand this system to work with Aspect Oriented Programming, and Static and Dynamic Proxies. I'll also explore the best ways of implementing the control logic under the hood.
Till then, I guess we're stuck with Asserts or ifs at the beginning of methods.
