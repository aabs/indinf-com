<p>Well, <a href="http://www.linkme.com.au">LinkMe </a>is coming to an end. Not literally - just my involvement in it. Yes, I am off again to a new place. This time it is <a href="http://www.readify.com/">Readify</a> - a smallish consultancy that specialises in emerging .NET technologies. They were recommended to me by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/frankarr/default.aspx">Frank Arrigo</a>, the group manager of the Microsoft Australian Evangelists, who rated them as an &#39;elite team&#39;. Hopefully, now I will get an opportunity to indulge my secret fetish. I am an EARLY-ADOPTER! There, it&#39;s said, I&#39;m out of the closet now.</p>
<p>Microsoft Australian Evangelists - sounds like a good name for a gospel-rock group...</p>
