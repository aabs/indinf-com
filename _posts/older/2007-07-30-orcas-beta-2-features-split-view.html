<p>In Beta 2, MS have given ASP.NET web forms and controls the Cider treatment. That is - you are shown the design and markup views side by side just as in the visual designer for WPF. This is called "Split View", and can be extremely useful - unless your page uses controls that don't behave well in design view. In that case you're probably going to want to turn them off.</p>

<p>If you need to turn off the default split view, to prevent&nbsp;VS from hanging for several minutes till it's rendering attempts timeout, then you will need to go into the Options dialog and change the settings. Goto <strong>Tools&gt;Options&gt;HTML Designer </strong>and select the <strong>Source View </strong>setting. That will change the default mode that the page will open in. It's a great improvement on VS2005, where if you double clicked on a web form you had little option but to wait for it to timeout.</p>

<p>If you've got a wide screen display, you might want to&nbsp;check "<strong>Split views vertically</strong>", to allow you to see more lines of source.</p>
