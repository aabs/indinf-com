[http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/first.php](http://acmicpc-live-archive.uva.es/nuevoportal/first.php) is a site of computer science and algorithmics problems that are published by the ACM. There are some very interesting problems in here. I haven't taken a look at any of the solutions, but this could be a very useful resource.
