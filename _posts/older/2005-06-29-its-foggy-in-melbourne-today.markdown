[![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/929/320/city_in_fog.gif)](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6860/929/1600/city_in_fog.gif) I got this from a tram stand on southbank this morning. Everyone was too intent on getting to work to notice how gorgeous it all was. Shame, cos I was astounded (for about 30 seconds before I scurried off to work as well).
