<p><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/">Semantic Overflow</a> has been active for a couple of weeks. We now have 155 <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users">users </a>and 53 <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions">questions</a>. We've already had some very interesting questions and some excellent detailed and thoughtful responses. I thought, on Egon's <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/245/who-set-up-this-website-and-how-can-we-reach-him-her">instigation</a>, to  bring together, from the site's BI stats, some of the highlights of last week.</p>
<p>The best loved question this week came from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/12/jerven">Jerven Bolleman</a> who wanted to know whether there was a "<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/235/simple-cli-useable-owl-reasoner">Simple CLI useable OWL Reasoner</a>". The most popular answer (and highest voted answer) came from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/140/ivan">Ivan Herman</a> who provided tool suggestions, guidance and insights into the current research directions.</p>
<p>The most viewed question was from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/79/patternexon">Akshat Shrivastava</a> who asked "<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/228/how-do-i-make-my-homepage-personal-blog-semantic">How do I make my homepage/personal blog semantic ?</a>". This question garnered 5 very good answers, including a particularly good one from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/69/billroberts">Bill Roberts</a>, who provided a lot of detail on his own experiences of doing just that.</p>
<p>The highest voted answer was from <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/103/egon-willighagen">Egon Willighagen</a> in answer to a question by '<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/61/dusoft">dusoft</a>' as to "<a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/203/why-launching-semanticoverflow-with-too-little-users-with-zero-reputation-sucks">Why launching SemanticOverflow with too little users with zero reputation sucks?"</a>. He very helpfully explained how to bootstrap your reputation and make a success of the site. I'm glad to say that dusoft's was the only negative comment so far, and that the general response of other site users has been very positive. Mike McClintock even told me that "<em>SemanticOverflow is my new favorite thing</em>". Thanks, Mike, I hope it stays that way!</p>
<p>In terms of gathering reputation, <a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/users/56/ian-davis">Ian Davis</a> of Talis is the clear front runner with the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/64/what-data-would-be-most-valuable-as-linked-data">What data would be most valuable as Linked Data?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/193/can-atom-be-considered-linked-data">Can Atom be considered Linked Data?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/94/how-can-we-make-it-easier-to-work-with-linked-data">How can we make it easier to work with Linked Data?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/182/marking-up-a-table-with-rdfa">Marking up a table with RDFa</a></li>
</ul>
<p>He also provided 17 very good answers. Thanks, Ian, and thanks to all the others who are already making Semantic Overflow a great site!</p>
