<p>It appears that Boo has <a href="http://yoick.wordpress.com/2006/11/25/yoick-wotf-boo-2-to-launch/">reincarnated</a> to drag us down, once again. Of course, it won't be possible without the help of Aggy Finn who was with them at the time<span style="font-size:9pt;">*</span>.</p>
<p>This is how he escaped last time:</p>

	</p>
<p>If the contractor wages go down to 10GBP/hr again, Aggy, I shall be blaming you!!!!!</p>
<p><span style="font-size:9pt;">* Needless to say, most this is a pack of lies. Especially the bit about Aggy being responsible.</span></p>
