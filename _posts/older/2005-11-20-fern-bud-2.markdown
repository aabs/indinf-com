This bud for a tree fern was about the size of my hand with fingers outstretched. It would be great to get a time laps of one of these unfolding. mind you, the humidity would have fritzed my camera way before it got through the sequence.

I love the fractal symmetry in the self similarity on each scale. I wonder how many levels of spiral there are in these buds? I guess I could work it out my looking at the levels of structure in an outstretched frond.

Frond - I love that word. I once bought an album by a band called 'the bevis frond', just because I loved the word - bloody stupid really, cos the music was an atrocity as I recal, anyway the minds a blank.
