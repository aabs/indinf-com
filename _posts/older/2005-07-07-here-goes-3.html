<p>I have taken this stuff to the point where it is not too scruffy to release to the world. What I need to do now is publicise it to the world at large. Any ideas about the best forums for that?<br />
I think SourceForgeand gotdotnet will help, but I can also imagine that sharptools and USENET might be good avenues to publicise it through. How will I manage the project when I open the code up to the open source community?</p>
<p>The SourceForge project location is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/aabsdbc/">here</a>.<br />
The GotDotNet project location is <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=24fe7e5d-e342-4ad9-a749-8048020f2828">here</a>.</p>
