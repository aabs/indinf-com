<p>A new <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-10/osu-mdm102506.php">study</a>, just released, indicates that social-drinking lab rats have improved memories over those that do not. Researchers hung out in the same bars as the rats, asking them probing questions after nights on the <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">town</span>bench?</p>
<p>As an Englishman, I have been known to indulge, or even overindulge, in the past. But for some reason, that I can't fathom, over the last year or two I have stopped drinking. Perhaps I just forgot to... do whatever it was we were talking about.</p>
