<p>I got the following in an email disclaimer that foreshadows interesting times ahead:</p>
<p><em>This email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed.</em><br />
<em><br />
Sounds like humans are only part of the game these days, and "<em>entities</em>" will be asserting their rights more forcefully in future. Perhaps such entities represent affiliated groups of humans, but perhaps they represent other semi-sentient information agregates such as software agents or epi-phenomena growing out there on the web as viruses or telephone exchanges?</p>
<p>One Question - How many of you reading this fall into the non-human category?</p>
<p align="right">Thanks to GlennD for this signpost to the future</p>
