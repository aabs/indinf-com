<p>I'm not peeved any more â€“ I'm contrite. WordPress doesn't provide nice pre tag CSS, because it is XHTML compliant and supports the code tag. Not only that they just added a sweet new HTML editor that will make your posts XHTML compliant for you in the background. All is forgiven. Thank god I didn't find a good free ASP.NET hosting service.</p>
