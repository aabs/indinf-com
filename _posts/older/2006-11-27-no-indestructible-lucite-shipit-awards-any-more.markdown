I have to admit that my impression of what life must be like inside of Microsoft stems mostly from reading [Microserfs](http://www.amazon.com/Microserfs-Douglas-Coupland/dp/0060987049/sr=1-1/qid=1164625710/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-3654771-9931000?ie=UTF8&s=books) by Douglas Coupland. As a result, I was disappointed to [discover](http://blogs.msdn.com/nigelwat/archive/2006/10/27/when-words-just-aren-t-enough.aspx) that when stuff gets shipped these days, they give each other cakes instead of indestructible Lucite plaques.


Here's the proof:

My guess is they probably didn't tie it to the back of a car and drive around the block either.
