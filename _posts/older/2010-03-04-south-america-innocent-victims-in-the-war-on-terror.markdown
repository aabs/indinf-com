Are you kidding me? **tectonic causes for south american earthquakes** was a total sham! Think about it! Everyone knows that **there's a war on**. And have you noticed that **the CIA** has started to act very strangely? They obviously don’t want this story getting out. I mean, what would happen if people began asking **Why are they all near the USA**? Well, they may be able to fool the sheeple, but the members of **the USGS** aren't swallowing their story. Look, don’t take it from me; **General Colin Powell** is convinced as well. But we have to act fast, because **Yellowstone will vaporize the USA**. I just wanted you to be aware of this, in case I disappear.
